# Bike Demand Rental Prediction

This project explores how predictive modelling can be used to understand and forecast hourly bike rental demand based on environmental and temporal factors.

## Overview

Using the **Seoul Bike Sharing Demand** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand), this notebook covers:

- Problem formulation and objective
- Data acquisition and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modelling using machine learning techniques
- Evaluation and insights
